# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI)

HPAI Virus: 
- The main way the HPAI virus spreads is through bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes.
- HPAI can also be passed through sexual contact or from a pregnant woman to her developing baby.
- If a pregnant person gets HPAI, it can cause serious birth defects for the child.
- Unfortunately, there's currently no vaccine or medication to prevent or treat HPAI itself.

  # What to Know:
Influenza A viruses are endemic (can infect and regularly transmit) in 6 animal species or groups (wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, swine, horses, dogs, and bats) in addition to humans.

  # Prevention:
-  People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses.

-  If you must have direct/close contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).

# [Full Dataset Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI?p=full)

This link provides a comprehensive overview of the HPAI virus dataset used for the analysis, including all related views and metadata.

Explore the phylogenetic tree of HPAI virus strains. This view provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among different viral samples.

# [Entropy Analysis](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI?d=entropy&p=full)

Analyze the entropy of the HPAI virus genome. This slide focuses on the variability and evolutionary pressures acting on different genomic regions.
