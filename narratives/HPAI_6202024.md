# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI)

HPAI Virus: 
- The main way the HPAI virus spreads is through bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes.
- HPAI can also be passed through sexual contact or from a pregnant woman to her developing baby.
- If a pregnant person gets HPAI, it can cause serious birth defects for the child.
- Unfortunately, there's currently no vaccine or medication to prevent or treat HPAI itself.

  # Treatment:
If you're experiencing symptoms of HPAI, call your healthcare provider.  While there's no cure for HPAI itself, getting plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage your symptoms.

  # Symptoms:
- Fever

- Rash

- Headache

- Joint pain

- Red eyes

- Muscle pain
