# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/hpai)

HPAI Virus: 
- H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows with one recent human case in a U.S. dairy worker.
- While the current public health risk is low, CDC is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposure.
- CDC is using its flu surveillance systems to monitor for H5N1 activity in people

  # Treatment:
If you're experiencing symptoms of Zika, call your healthcare provider.  While there's no cure for Zika itself, getting plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage your symptoms.

  # Symptoms:
- Fever

- Rash

- Headache

- Joint pain

- Red eyes

- Muscle pain
