# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI)

HPAI Virus:
The highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus, prevalent in wild birds around the world, has sparked outbreaks in poultry farms and, in a concerning development,  U.S. dairy cattle.  Although a single dairy worker recently contracted the virus, public health officials maintain the current risk to humans remains low. However, the CDC is closely monitoring the situation and collaborating with states to track potential human exposures linked to animal contact.

# What to Know:
-  HPAI viruses can be transmitted by wild birds to domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.

# Prevention:
- People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses.
- If you must have direct/close contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).
