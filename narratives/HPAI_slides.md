# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/hpai)

HPAI Virus:
- H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows with one recent human case in a U.S. dairy worker.
- While the current public health risk is low, the CDC is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people who are exposed to animals.
- CDC is using its flu surveillance systems to monitor for H5N1 activity in people.

# What to Know:
Influenza A viruses are endemic (can infect and regularly transmit) in 6 animal species or groups (wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, swine, horses, dogs, and bats) in addition to humans.

# Prevention:
- People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses.
- If you must have direct/close contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).

# [Full Dataset Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI?p=full)

This link provides a comprehensive overview of the HPAI virus dataset used for the analysis, including all related views and metadata.

Explore the phylogenetic tree of HPAI virus strains. This view provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among different viral samples.

# [Entropy Analysis](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI?d=entropy&p=full)

Analyze the entropy of the HPAI virus genome. This slide focuses on the variability and evolutionary pressures acting on different genomic regions.
