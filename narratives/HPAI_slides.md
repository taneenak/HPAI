# [Introduction to the HPAI virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI)

HPAI Virus:
The highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus, prevalent in wild birds around the world, has sparked outbreaks in poultry farms and, in a concerning development,  U.S. dairy cattle.  Although a single dairy worker recently contracted the virus, public health officials maintain the current risk to humans remains low. However, the CDC is closely monitoring the situation and collaborating with states to track potential human exposures linked to animal contact.

# What to Know:
-  Wild birds can transmit HPAI viruses to domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.

# Monitoring for Novel Influenza A virus infections among people, including Influenza A (H5N1)

# Prevention:
- People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses.
- If you must have direct/close contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).

# [This Dataset](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/HPAI)

This dataset is a subsampled version of a much bigger dataset with only H5 HPAI. This dataset has been subsampled against species and continent and we only have 56 genomes. Species have been categorized into 7 subtypes: Human, Wild Bird, Wild Mammal, Livestock Avian, Livestock Mammal, Pet, and Other Birds. 

In Wild Bird, we have 86 species; in Livestock Avia, we only have 10 species. Those 10 species include Chicken, Duck, Fowl, Goose, Ostrich, Pheasant, Poultry, Quail, Swan, and Turkey. 


Cats and Ferrets are considered pets. 
In this dataset, we have samples from Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Antarctica. 

In Livestock Mammal we only have 4 species: Dairy Cattle, Goat, Mink, and Swine. And in Wild Mammal we have 25 different species.
